# **Tracking weather** üå§Ô∏è

Write city and view the temperature and wind speed!  
Using API from [https://openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Built Using**

### Front-End
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML && CSS

### Back-End
- Express JS(server)
- MSSQL Server(Database)
- Sequelize(ORM)
- ip info(I use IP info because I want to obtain the users' coordinates to use them in making requests to the OpenWeather API. In this way, users are automatically shown the weather forecasts for their location without having to use a search function.)
